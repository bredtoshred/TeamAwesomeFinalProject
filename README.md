# TeamAwesomeFinalProject
CU CSCI 2270 Final Project

Our project will implement some of the functions of the social media wesite Facebook. The user will be prompted for a menu with options add friends, delete friends, create a new account, find mutual friends, check for peoples birthdays and find how many friends apart two individuals are (edge length). To do this the program will read in from, and update, a text file containing names, freinds(edges), and date of birth. The Program itself will implement friend lists using graphs and use structs to store information about individuals.
